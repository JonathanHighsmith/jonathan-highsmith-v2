        <h2>Leadership</h2>
        
        <p>To me leadership is a bond that you have with  your team and it's not about controll it's about respect and a bond because without respect from your team mates you cant lead them and to stay as a leader you have to keep a bond.</p>
        
        <h2>Teamwork</h2>
        
        <p>Teamwork is the process of working together to achieve something bigger. An example of team work is when a pride of lions work together to catch a bigger meal like a giraffe.</p>
